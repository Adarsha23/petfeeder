# Smart Pet Feeder

An IoT-enabled smart pet feeding system with remote monitoring and control capabilities.

## Project Overview

This project implements a low-cost, IoT-enabled smart pet feeder that combines ESP32-based hardware with a secure web application. The system provides precise portion control, remote monitoring, and comprehensive feeding analytics.

## Features (Planned)

- **Precise Portion Control**: Closed-loop feedback using HX711 load cell
- **Remote Monitoring**: Web-based dashboard for real-time status
- **Feeding History**: Detailed logs with timestamps and portion sizes
- **Multi-Caregiver Support**: Secure authentication and role-based access
- **Offline Operation**: Device functions independently with cloud sync
- **Pet Profiles**: Manage pet information and dietary requirements
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualize feeding patterns and trends
