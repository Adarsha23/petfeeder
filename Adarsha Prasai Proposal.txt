Abstract
This project proposes a low-cost, IoT-enabled smart pet feeder that combines an
ESP32-based hardware unit with a secure, data-driven web application. The device
performs closed-loop portion control using an HX711 load-cell interface, dispenses
food via a servo-driven mechanism, monitors water level with a float sensor, and
supports optional audio prompts through a DFPlayer Mini with an 8 Ω 1 W speaker.
The web application, built with React and a cloud-hosted backend, provides
authenticated access to manual feeding, pause/resume control, live video monitoring,
event notifications, pet profile management, and long-term feeding analytics. The aim
is to deliver a defensible prototype that goes beyond simple automation by introducing
a robust control plane, auditable logs, remote assurance, and human-in-the-loop
safety capabilities that cannot be credibly achieved by a headless device alone.

1. Introduction
Feeding a companion animal sounds simple until you try to make it reliable,
measurable, and responsive to the realities of modern life. Owners travel, work late,
and deal with changing routines. Pets have evolving dietary needs across life stages
and health conditions. The naive approach, dumping some kibble at fixed times can
turn into underfeeding, overfeeding, or inconsistent patterns that a caregiver only
notices once issues arise. Commercial feeders exist, but their design emphasizes
fixed schedules and basic app triggers rather than transparent, verifiable monitoring
integrated with the owner’s daily decisionmaking. In other words, the market has
shown the appetite for convenience, but the gap lies in trust, control, and data
continuity across contexts, caregivers, and devices. Systems that emphasize
scheduling alone treat feeding as a oneway actuation problem; real pet care is a
feedback problem that needs human oversight, measurement, and explainability.
Using the ESP32 as the control unit provides Wi-Fi connectivity, enough compute for
sensor fusion and motor control.. The web application complements the device by
serving as a control plane with secure identity, permissions, and analytics. Together,
they transform feeding from “press start and hope” into a continuous loop of sensing,
deciding, acting, and verifying. The feeder dispenses based on target mass rather than
crude time-based dispensing.

2. Problem Statement
There’s a real need for a smart pet feeder that’s reliable, easy to use, and aligned with
current market trends, combining precise portion control with a secure, cloudconnected interface. Owners should be able to check in, see logs, and stay in control
even from afar. Most current products either focus only on the mechanics of dispensing
or offer a basic app that doesn’t keep durable records or track events in a meaningful
way. Market research shows a growing demand for smart feeders that support remote
control and pet-care convenience (Company, 2025)Having a web interface as the main
control hub isn’t just convenient, it’s essential. It lets multiple caregivers collaborate,
keeps an auditable history, provides insights over time, and ensures the system still
works smoothly even when things don’t go perfectly in the real world. (WOPet, 2021)

3. Aims
The primary aim of this project is to design and implement a low-cost, IoT-enabled smart pet
feeder that ensures precise, reliable, and accountable feeding through the integration of
embedded hardware control and a secure, data-driven web application. The system seeks
to move beyond fixed-time automation by establishing a closed-loop feedback model where
each feeding event is measurable, verifiable, and traceable, thereby improving transparency,
trust, and remote accessibility in pet care.

5. Scope and Delimitations
The system lets owners manually feed their pets from the web interface while
keeping portion control precise using the load cell. Every feeding is logged with time
and dispensed amount, and the system tracks food and water levels through
weight. Owners get real-time notifications for feeding events or low levels. A pet
profile stores basic details and a photo, and feeds can be paused or resumed to
follow vet guidance or temporary fasting.
Features like multi-pet support and fully automated scheduling are intentionally left
out, as differentiating consumption between pets is tricky. Any scheduling logic might
appear as an experimental or disabled module, but the core system emphasizes
control, accuracy, and oversight via the web.
(PetSafe, 2025) (WOPet, 2021)

6. Related Systems
Previous research shows that IoT-based feeders can automate feeding using sensors and
actuators, but they often lack user-facing analytics or strong authentication. For example,
Khan et al. demonstrated a system combining microcontrollers with network connectivity,
proving the concept works, but left questions around robust logging, identity
management, and long-term web-scale maintenance [Khan et al., 2020].
More recent work by (Arceo, Flores, & Mancilla, 2024)describes a smart feeder combining
IoT hardware (weight sensors, camera, ultrasonic sensors) with deep learning for pet
recognition and precise portion dispensing. While this system demonstrates effective portion
control and automatic pet identification, it still focuses on embedded intelligence and does
not integrate a web application for audit logging, multi-user management, or human-in-theloop safety. Including this highlights the gap your project addresses by combining robust
web-based monitoring and control with the hardware.
On the commercial side, products like PetSafe, Smart Feed, and offerings from WOPet
show advanced hardware and strong consumer demand, but they are usually closed
systems, focused on retail polish rather than research flexibility or transparent data export

6
The current state of the art gives us mechanical dispensing, app-triggered actions, and basic
alerts, yet it doesn’t fully integrate the web application as a core part of safety,
measurement, and accountability. In particular, little has been written about balancing
device autonomy with cloud control, especially when connectivity is unreliable or multiple
caregivers are involved.
This project fills that gap by formalizing the interface between device and cloud,
implementing “intent → actuation → verification” loops, and showing how authenticated
events can serve as a trusted record of the pet’s care history.
(Arceo, Flores, & Mancilla, 2024) (PetSafe, 2025) (WOPet, 2021)

7. Methodology

The system is built around an ESP32, chosen for its Wi-Fi, GPIO availability, and
reliable tooling. It controls a servo to dispense kibble, reads mass through a load cell,
and plays audio via a DFPlayer Mini. Feeding is a closed-loop process: the scale is
tared, kibble is dispensed while mass is continuously monitored, and dispensing stops
once the target is reached. HX711 readings are smoothed using moving average or
median filters, and calibration relies on reference weights. Every feed logs the

7
requested and actual mass, dispense time, and any anomalies, forming a detailed
event log.
The networking design is resilient: the ESP32 can complete feeds offline, while the
web server issues commands with idempotent tokens over REST or MQTT. Offline
requests queue and execute once the device reconnects, ensuring durable, auditable
actions.
The React web app manages authentication, device association, event storage, and
notifications. Users can manually trigger feeds, track progress, and explore detailed
event timelines. Pet profiles store name, breed, age, weight, and height. Notifications
cover feed completion, low food, and low water.
Security is robust: TLS, signed tokens, replay protection, and feed logging create a
trustworthy audit trail.
Calibration is guided: the web app collects raw ADC counts, calculates slope/offset,
stores versioned parameters, and pushes reference data to the device. Persistent drift
triggers recalibration, ensuring accurate, reliable mass measurements.

8. Expected Outcomes
By the end of the project, the system should demonstrate that smart pet feeding can be done
accurately, safely, and transparently through a connected web platform. The feeder and web
app will work together to show that pet care can be monitored and controlled from anywhere
with trust and consistency.
•

Accurate Feeding:
The feeder will dispense food portions that closely match the target weight, with
minimal error after calibration.

•

Reliable Operation:
The system will keep functioning even if the internet goes down and will automatically
update feeding data once reconnected.

•

User Control and Awareness:
Users will be able to monitor, pause, or trigger feeds from the web interface, with clear
logs and notifications showing exactly what happened and when.

•

Improved Trust and Safety:
The combination of event logs and notifications will give users confidence that feeding
is happening as expected, even when they are away.

•

Data and Insight:
Feeding history will be stored in a structured form, making it possible to analyze longterm trends and support future features like portion recommendations.

•

Learning and Skill Development:
The project will demonstrate practical skills in IoT integration, web development, data
handling, and system security, key areas for full-stack and embedded system
development.

9. Why the Web Application Is Essential
The heart of the defense is this: the web application is the safety, accountability, and
collaboration layer. A purely embedded schedule would dispense food, but it would not
provide a durable record of who did what, when, and with what outcome. For example,
if a veterinarian prescribes a temporary reduction in portions, the ability to pause
remotely, see that the command was applied, and verify that subsequent feed attempts
were blocked is essential. If the device jams, the log shows the partial dispense, the
alert, and any remediation.
Without the web, owners cannot compare their pet’s feeding patterns over time. Say
you want to check your pet’s intake over the last three months versus the same period
last year, without a web interface storing and visualizing historical data, this kind of
analysis would be nearly impossible. Research supports this: according to
Investigation into the aetiology of hypercalcaemia in a cohort of 44 cats, veterinarians
can diagnose health problems significantly faster when they have detailed feeding
pattern reports. (Knowles, et al., 2020)
Without a backend, notifications cannot be reliably delivered or archived; without a UI,
calibration and analytics are hidden behind serial commands that the average user will
not run. The web layer transforms an opaque IoT gadget into an observable,
accountable service, which is essential for adoption and quality care.
From an academic perspective, the web app also multiplies learning opportunities:
implementing secure authentication, modelling device state in a database, designing
APIs with idempotency, handling eventual consistency, and building data
visualizations that interpret sensor readings in human terms. These are core,
transferable skills in modern software engineering, which a strong FYP should surface.
This project is therefore not “a feeder plus a pretty page”; it is a controlled cyberphysical system whose correctness is amplified and made defensible by the web layer.
Commercial feeders demonstrate user demand for remote control, and prior academic
work shows device feasibility; this project integrates these strands while framing the
website as the custodian of safety, accountability, and actionable insight, not an
optional accessory. (WOPet, 2021) (PetSafe, 2025) (Adnan Shah, Tajuddin, Darzi, &
Malgi, 2023) (E. Bray, Zheng , Tolbert, & Kaeberlein, 2022) (Knowles, Marshall, &
Girling, 2020)

10. Work Plan and Timeline (Nine Months)

The project will be executed over nine months, starting with four weeks of research and
planning to study existing systems, select suitable hardware, and define the project workflow.
The next four weeks will focus on system design, including hardware schematics, sensor
placement, and web application structure. Hardware setup will take six weeks, assembling
and calibrating the ESP32, load cell, servo mechanism, DFPlayer, camera module, and float
sensor. Web application development will span ten weeks, covering frontend, backend,
database, authentication, and core features like manual feed control, event logging,
notifications, and pet profiles. Integration of the hardware with the web application will occur
over four weeks, ensuring real-time communication and control. Testing and debugging will
take another four weeks to verify accuracy, reliability, and usability. Finally, four weeks will
be dedicated to documentation and the final report, including diagrams, user manuals, and
summarizing project outcomes and future scope.

dispensing mechanism.

•

Sensing Risks
Ø Include calibration and warm-up routines in firmware.
Ø The user interface prompts periodic recalibration using reference weights.

•

Network Risks
Ø Provide a minimal offline mode for manual feed commands.
Ø Ensure the device reconciles its state with the server once connectivity is restored.

•

Security Risks
Ø Use short-lived authentication tokens.
Ø Enforce strict device-to-user association rules.

•

Timeline Risks
Ø Prioritize the core system first: manual feeding, closed-loop portion measurement,
and event logging.
Ø Treat camera integration and advanced notifications as secondary enhancements.

(Systems, 2021) (Adnan Shah, Tajuddin, Darzi, & Malgi, 2023)

13

13. Evaluation Plan
The project will be evaluated through a combination of functional testing, performance
measurement, and user feedback to ensure that the smart pet feeder performs reliably
under real-world conditions.
•

Functional Testing:
Ø Verify that the feeder dispenses the correct food amount per schedule and on manual
command.
Ø Confirm the sensors and communication modules operate without interruption.
Ø Ensure the system logs every feeding event accurately and displays it in the web
interface.

•

Performance Evaluation:
Ø Measure accuracy of food portioning (acceptable deviation ≤ ±5 grams).
Ø Test response time between user command and device action (< 5 seconds).
Ø Observe system stability during network interruptions and reconnection events.

•

User Evaluation:
Ø Conduct usability testing with at least 3 users to assess clarity of the interface, ease
of operation, and overall satisfaction.
Ø Collect qualitative feedback on trust, transparency, and perceived usefulness of
remote monitoring.

•

Security and Reliability Assessment:
Ø Test data encryption, authentication, and communication reliability between the web
server and feeder.
Ø Evaluate data recovery after temporary disconnection or power failure.

14
•

Final Validation:
Ø Compare real-world feeding accuracy, system reliability, and user satisfaction results
against initial expected outcomes.

14. Future Scope
In the future, the server can generate recommendations based on consumption trends
observable in the logs, offering evidence-based portion suggestions rather than blind
schedules. Multi-pet support becomes tractable when paired with camera-based
recognition that associates consumption with individuals, which, combined with perpet profiles, could transition the system from a generic feeder to a personalized
nutrition assistant. Integrations with smart assistants are also possible. Over-the-air
firmware updates could be initiated from the web interface so that security patches roll
out safely. Data export and privacy controls would allow users to take their logs
elsewhere or contribute anonymized data to research. All of these are aligned with the
goal of making the web application a durable, ethical custodian of a pet’s feeding.
