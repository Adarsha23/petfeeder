1. Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled pervasive interconnectivity
across devices, allowing automation to extend into domestic and
companion-animal environments. Within the pet care ecosystem, smart
feeders offer scheduling convenience, portion consistency, and remote
control. However, despite commercial success, technical limitations
persist in most systems. Existing feeders typically use time-based control
or uncalibrated rotation, with minimal regard for actual dispensed weight.
Consequently, feeding errors, overdispensing, and lack of supervision
undermine reliability, especially during owner absence.
Automation in pet care contributes not only to convenience but also to
animal health, enabling consistent feeding patterns and mitigating human
error. Yet the underlying technical challenge remains: translating
mechanical actuation into verified nutritional outcomes. In open-loop
feeders, servo motors dispense based on pre-timed durations rather than
feedback from actual food weight.
Security, auditability, and resilience are therefore essential qualities of
next-generation smart feeders. From a system perspective, these
features demand a robust embedded control loop, a synchronized cloud
architecture, and a human-in-the-loop safety model. The proposed IoTEnabled Closed-Loop Smart Pet Feeder with Multi-Caregiver Web
Application and Analytics aims to unify these dimensions. By combining
precise load-cell-based control, secure cloud integration, and an offlinefirst design, it provides verifiable automation even in intermittent network
environments.

2. Literature Review

2.1. Design of Smart Pet Food Dispenser using Embedded
System
•

Name of the paper: Design of Smart Pet Food Dispenser using

Embedded System
• Type of paper: Conference paper (IEEE Proceedings)
• Pages: 1–6
• Authors: E. Jain, S. Sharma, R. Agarwal, and N. K. Gupta
• University: Symbiosis Institute of Technology, Pune, India
• Relation: Introduces a microcontroller-based automatic pet feeder using
Arduino and basic IoT integration; demonstrates open-loop control without
verification forms baseline mechanical automation that my FYP expands
into closed-loop accuracy with analytics.
• Where found: IEEE Xplore
(Jain, et al., 2023)
• Results

The prototype successfully dispensed food at user-defined intervals and
was remotely triggerable through the Firebase-connected app. The
authors reported correct motor actuation and stable Wi-Fi control within a
local LAN range. However, they did not quantify weight accuracy or
latency metrics. User tests were demonstrated qualitatively by showing
dispensing at scheduled times. No numerical performance evaluation
(such as portion error or throughput) was presented. Therefore, results
remain proof-of-concept level rather than validated metrics.

3
• Limitations

The system is open-loop: it does not verify the actual mass dispensed
against the target. The Firebase link provides no security or audit trail, and
the mobile interface lacks multi-user access control. Offline functionality
is absent since the ESP8266 cannot queue commands without network.
The design relies on real-time clock schedules hard-coded in firmware,
making updates inflexible. No human-in-the-loop safety or notification
logic exists, and feed errors cannot be detected autonomously.

2.2. Implementation of an IoT Based Pet Care System
• Name of the paper: Implementation of an IoT Based Pet Care System
• Type of paper: Conference article (IEEE)
• Authors: Y. Chen and M. Elshakankiri
• University: University of Regina
• Relation: Proposes an IoT edge-based pet monitoring system using
Raspberry Pi and AWS; focuses on latency improvement, not feed
accuracy relates to my review by demonstrating MQTT-based IoT control
and showing lack of closed-loop reliability.
• Where found: IEEE Xplore
(Chen & Elshakankiri, 2020)

4
• Results

The system demonstrated low-latency control under edge processing
(~50–80 ms average response). The authors reported successful remote
video streaming and feeding activation. Quantitative metrics focused on
network delay and throughput but not feeding accuracy. The solution
showed that edge-assisted IoT can reduce delay compared to pure cloud
architecture. However, no testing of portion precision or device autonomy
was performed.
• Limitations

Hardware cost was high due to Raspberry Pi and AWS use. The system
depends on constant Internet availability; no offline operation or recovery
logic exists. Security measures were limited to AWS credentials and did
not cover end-to-end device authentication or auditing. The architecture
is general pet care, not specialized in precise feeding. Data persistence
and multi-user roles were not addressed. Furthermore, the design did not
measure real-world feed outcome against desired target values.

5
2.3. IoT and Cloud-based Automated Pet Care System
• Name of the paper: IoT and Cloud-based Automated Pet Care System
• Type of paper: Journal article (IEEE Access / digital proceedings)
• Authors: M. Rajani Devi, V. Jyothi, and D. Nagajyoti
• University: Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad,
India
• Relation: Describes a cloud-connected feeding and watering system
controlled by Blynk and ThingSpeak; demonstrates successful scheduling
but lacks mass verification, supports my argument for integrating closedloop sensing and offline capability.
• Where found: IEEE Xplore
(Devi, et al., 2022)
• Results

The device worked reliably for remote commands through the Blynk
interface and maintained connectivity with the ThingSpeak cloud. The
authors reported successful data upload of feed events and pet presence
detection. However, quantitative results such as error percentage of food
dispensed or latency values were not included. The results are thus
functional verifications rather than statistical analysis.

6
• Limitations

Key limitations include lack of closed-loop feedback, no weight
verification, and dependency on external cloud servers for core
functionality. Offline operation fails if Wi-Fi disconnects. Data is visible only
to the account holder; no multi-user role support exists. Security and data
integrity are not discussed. The architecture is single-point of failure with
limited fault recovery.

2.4. Modular Pet Feeding Device
• Name of the paper: Modular Pet Feeding Device
• Type of paper: Student project research report / institutional publication
• Authors: V. C. M., P. Rao, S. Kiran, and A. Fernandes
• University: Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, Bengaluru, India
• Relation: Focuses on hardware modularity of feeders without
networking or analytics; forms the mechanical foundation that my FYP
builds upon by adding IoT feedback, web dashboards, and authentication.
• Where found: Google Scholar
(M., et al., 2023)
• Results

Testing showed that the device could dispense food consistently when
manually triggered. Measurements of portion uniformity were limited to
visual inspection. The authors reported “accurate dispensing” qualitatively
but did not provide numeric error data or sensor readings. The device ran
on a 12 V DC supply and could operate autonomously without a network.

7
• Limitations

The system lacks any smart functionality or communication layer. It cannot
be remotely controlled or monitored, nor store historical feed records.
Sensor precision is insufficient for accurate mass measurement. Without
a backend or app, multi-user interaction and auditing are impossible. The
authors did not address security, calibration, or human-in-loop features

2.5. Automatic Pet Feed System Applying IoT
•

Name of the paper: Automatic Pet Feed System Applying IoT

• Type of paper: Journal article (Modelling, Measurement and
Control D)
• Pages: 87–93
• Authors: A. V. C. Rangel, I. U. Ponce, and I. Soto
• University: Instituto de Ingenieria y Tecnologia
• Relation: Presents an IoT feeder with HX711 sensor and
ThingSpeak cloud logging; lacks feedback control or authentication,
directly aligns with my review focus on transforming one-way data
collection into verifiable closed-loop systems.
• Where found: Measurement and Control D (International Journal)
(Rangel, et al., 2024)

8
• Results

The prototype achieved stable network connectivity and successfully
recorded feed data on ThingSpeak. The authors confirmed accurate
logging of feeding instances and real-time updates. However, they omitted
quantitative accuracy measures, no error analysis between intended and
actual dispensed mass or timing variance. Testing was limited to short
demonstrations under stable Wi-Fi conditions.

• Limitations

Major weaknesses include lack of closed-loop verification, total
dependence on connectivity, and unaddressed security. The system
cannot adapt to motor variation or grain density differences. Blynk and
ThingSpeak impose external dependency and poor scalability. There is no
human oversight, error recovery, or multi-user model.

9
2.6. IoT Based Automatic Pet Feeder
• Name of the paper: IoT Based Automatic Pet Feeder
• Type of paper: Journal article (International Journal of Scientific
Research in Science, Engineering and Technology – IJSRSET)
• Pages: 570–577
• Authors: R. Robert, C.Jerisha, S.Mable Vimala, N.S. Nanthini, and
T.Saranya
• University: Annai Vailankanni College of Engineering
• Relations: Demonstrates timed servo control for feeding through Blynk
with no verification or data persistence; serves as an early open-loop
reference, highlighting why my FYP’s feedback and audit systems are
necessary.
• Where found: IJSRSET (Volume 9, Issue 8)
(R.Robert, et al., 2021)
• Results

Functional testing verified that feeding actions occurred at scheduled
times, with reported sub-second response to mobile commands. The
system demonstrated consistent motor rotation but lacked numeric
validation of portion consistency. The authors documented photos of
successful feeding as qualitative evidence.

10
• Limitations

This system cannot adjust or verify dispensed amounts, has no fault
tolerance, and depends entirely on Internet access. There are no
authentication or audit mechanisms. Calibration, measurement, and user
control granularity are minimal. Offline operation, analytics, or multicaregiver control are absent.

11
2.7. Design and Development of a Smart Pet Feeder with IoT and
Deep Learning
• Name of the paper: Design and Development of a Smart Pet Feeder
with IoT and Deep Learning
• Type of paper: Conference paper (MDPI Proceedings of 8th
International Electronic Conference on Sensors and Applications)
• Authors: Oscar E. Castillo-Arceo, Ricardo U. Ruiz Flores, and Patricia
C. Santana Mancilla
• University: Universidad de Colima, Mexico
• Relation: Integrates IoT hardware with YOLOv5-based pet recognition;
strong AI use but lacks multi-user control or audit trail, supports my
argument for extending smart feeders into secure, transparent IoT
ecosystems.
• Where found: MDPI Proceedings
(Castillo-Arceo, et al., 2024)
• Results

The authors achieved functional pet recognition and portion dispensing
aligned to pet identity. They claimed accurate pet differentiation and stable
HX711 readings. However, they omitted numerical accuracy or timing
results. Performance metrics such as detection confidence or feed error
were absent.

12
• Limitations

Despite AI integration, the feeder operated as a self-contained device with
no authenticated cloud control or multi-user oversight. There was no audit
log or notification mechanism. Dependence on environmental lighting
could reduce detection reliability. Offline behaviour, data reconciliation,
and user verification were untested.

2.8. Overall Gap Analysis
• Common Gaps:

o Absence of closed-loop control: Only two works mention load
cells, and neither performs continuous feedback correction or
quantitative evaluation of mass error.
o Lack of security and auditability: Every reviewed system
except Castillo-Arceo et al. operates without authentication,
encryption, or verified logs. Firebase or Blynk connections
dominate, offering convenience but no durable record integrity.
o Network dependency: Offline resilience is universally absent.
Systems fail entirely without Wi-Fi, indicating no local autonomy
or synchronization strategy.
o Single-user limitation: None support multi-caregiver models or
role-based access. Pet management remains isolated to a single
mobile user.
o No human-in-the-loop verification: Automation occurs blindly
with no acknowledgment, override, or feedback channel.

3. Proposed System
3.1. Concept Overview
The conceptual framework envisions an IoT system composed of
interlinked hardware, firmware, and software modules operating in a
closed-loop configuration. At its core, an ESP32 microcontroller
interfaces with an HX711 load cell amplifier and servo motor to
dispense precise feed portions. Data communication occurs through a
hybrid model of local control and cloud synchronization, allowing the
system to function offline and reconcile data when reconnected. The web
application serves as the supervisory layer, hosting multi-user access,
analytics, and audit logging.
(Conceptual Architecture Diagram Placeholder)

3.2. System Architecture and Module Interactions
3.2.1. ESP32 Control Unit
The ESP32 serves as the central processing and communication hub,
managing sensor input, actuator control, and network communication
(Whitepaper, 2024). It continuously reads load cell data via the HX711
ADC and applies a feedback algorithm to maintain target feed mass.
When network connectivity is unavailable, data is cached locally in flash
memory and queued for transmission upon reconnection.
3.2.2. HX711 Load Cell Amplifier
The HX711 measures the real-time weight of dispensed feed with high
precision. By embedding this sensor into a feedback loop, the system
monitors the actual mass dispensed and terminates feeding once the
desired threshold is reached (Team, 2024) Calibration coefficients are
stored in non-volatile memory, ensuring repeatable accuracy.

14
3.2.3. Servo Motor Dispensing Module
The servo controls a gate mechanism that regulates pellet flow. The
ESP32 modulates servo angle in response to HX711 readings. This
constitutes a proportional feedback mechanism where dispensing
continues until the error between target and actual weight approaches
zero (Staff, 2025).
3.2.4. IoT Communication and Cloud Integration
The system employs either MQTT or RESTful HTTP for data transmission.
MQTT

provides

asynchronous,

low-overhead

updates

ideal

for

constrained IoT devices, while REST API offers transactional reliability for
audit events (Rahman, 2024). A cloud backend—integrated per best
practices for resilient IoT architecture (Team, 2025) stores feeding logs,
calibration parameters, and user actions.
3.2.5. Web Application and Multi-Caregiver Control
The web app, developed using a modern frontend framework (e.g., React
or Next.js), interacts through secure APIs. Authentication follows
lightweight, mutual verification protocols suitable for IoT ecosystems
(Shehu, et al., 2025). Role-based access control allows multiple
caregivers to manage schedules collaboratively while preserving
accountability. Event logging adheres to principles outlined in (Team,
2025) ensuring immutability and traceability of all interactions.
3.2.6. Offline Synchronization and Analytics
During network loss, feeding records and control events are timestamped
locally. Upon reconnection, the device compares local and server logs,
resolving conflicts using idempotent tokens to prevent duplication.
Analytics modules in the web app visualize feeding frequency, average
portion mass, and deviation trends, following practices from (Team, 2025).

15
3.3. Security, Audit, and Human Oversight
Authentication, encryption, and event logging form the trust backbone.
Following guidance from (Team, 2023) and (Wu, et al., 2020) the system
employs HTTPS with token-based session validation. All feed events are
auditable and reversible by authorized users. Notification mechanisms
alert caregivers of anomalies or feeding completion, ensuring human-inloop supervision.

4. Technology Overview
4.1. HX711 Load Cell Amplifier
The HX711 is a 24-bit analog-to-digital converter optimized for weight
sensing. It amplifies microvolt-level signals from the load cell, enabling
detection of minute mass variations. In this system, it provides real-time
feedback for the dispensing servo, forming the foundation of the closedloop control algorithm (Team, 2024).
4.2. Servo Motor
A micro servo motor translates control signals from the ESP32 into
mechanical movement for the feeding gate. Pulse-width modulation
(PWM) defines its angular position. When paired with the HX711
feedback, the servo dynamically adjusts to maintain dispensing accuracy
within a predefined tolerance band (Staff, 2025).
4.3. ESP32 Microcontroller
The ESP32, with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-core processor, handles
sensor readings, feedback calculations, and network communications
concurrently. Its embedded flash storage enables offline data caching and
synchronization on reconnection (Whitepaper, 2024).

16
4.4. MQTT vs HTTP REST Communication
MQTT supports lightweight, bidirectional communication suitable for realtime IoT telemetry, whereas REST ensures structured, authenticated
requests (Rahman, 2024) . This system proposes MQTT for live feed-state
updates and REST for log synchronization and user transactions.
4.5. Cloud Integration
Cloud services maintain a persistent data layer, following principles from
(Team, 2025). The architecture leverages serverless APIs for device
communication and NoSQL storage for rapid feed log queries.
4.6. Web Application and Logging Mechanisms
A React-based dashboard interfaces with backend APIs for control and
visualization. It implements detailed logging-login attempts, schedule
modifications, and feed completions, based on the design guidelines in
(Team, 2023) and (Team, 2025).
4.7. IoT Security and Authentication
The project employs mutual authentication and token-based validation to
protect device-cloud sessions (Title: "Authentication Schemes for Internet
of Things (IoT) Networks"). All communication uses HTTPS with certificate
pinning

and

salted

hash

storage

for

credentials,

adhering

to

recommendations in (Wu, et al., 2020).
4.8. Analytics and Visualization
Data analytics modules use aggregated feed data to compute average
portion accuracy, caregiver activity frequency, and trend analysis.
Visualization dashboards follow frameworks described in (Team, 2025).

17

5. Research Gap and Motivation
Existing smart pet feeders demonstrate limited technical maturity. Most
operate under open-loop control, dispensing food for fixed durations
without verifying actual output mass. This results in inconsistent feeding
and potential overfeeding issues particularly critical for diet-sensitive
animals. While prior designs such as those surveyed in (Company, 2025),
indicate increasing automation, they largely prioritize convenience over
accuracy or transparency.
Connectivity dependence poses further risks. Feeders relying exclusively
on continuous Wi-Fi cannot operate during network disruptions, leaving
pets unfed. Existing systems rarely implement offline caching or
synchronization models (team & Oliynyk, 2024). Consequently, IoT-based
pet feeders remain vulnerable to both communication failures and data
inconsistency.
From a systems perspective, these gaps represent deficiencies in
feedback control, data governance, and operational resilience. The
proposed project directly addresses these through:
• Closed-loop feedback control for verified portion accuracy using
HX711 mass readings.
• Secure, multi-caregiver web platform supporting authenticated
roles and auditable logs (Team, 2025)
• Offline-first synchronization ensuring functional continuity under
network loss (Team, 2025)
• Integrated analytics dashboard offering measurable performance
feedback and feeding trends (Team, 2025).

18

6. Conclusion
This research review established a conceptual framework for a nextgeneration IoT-enabled smart pet feeder emphasizing precision, security,
and collaborative management. The system architecture integrates a
closed-loop feedback mechanism, an authenticated multi-caregiver web
platform, and an analytics-driven control layer.
Compared to existing feeders that rely on static timing and single-user
mobile control, this conceptual system embodies a holistic approach,
linking embedded hardware intelligence with secure cloud orchestration.
The integration of the HX711-based feedback control introduces
quantitative reliability, while the offline-first synchronization model
addresses real-world connectivity constraints.
The project’s long-term vision extends toward intelligent behavioral
analytics and adaptive feeding through AI integration (M., et al., 2023).
